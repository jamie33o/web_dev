"""
In Python programming, 
sequences are a generic term for an ordered set which means that the order in 
which we input the items will be the same when we access them.
 Python supports six different types of sequences. 
These are strings, lists, tuples, byte sequences, byte arrays, and range objects.

print(name[0])

# python list - sequences of mutable values
name = ["Harry","ron","jamie"]

print(name[0])

#tuple pair values that arent goin to change
coordinate = (10.0, 20.0)

#set - collection of unique values

#dict - collection of key value pairs
